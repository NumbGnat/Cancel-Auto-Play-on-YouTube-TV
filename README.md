## Cancel-Auto-Play-on-YouTube-TV
An *_Automate_* Flo that automatically presses the `Cancel` button, when YouTube TV tries to Auto-Play the next episode of what you're watching.

A Flo is a proprietary binary format, so code can't be managed in GitHub. You can only view the Flo in the *_Automate_* app. Once installed, the Flo can be found in the Automate community here...

###. Details

YouTube TV likes to automatically play the next episode unless you press `Cancel`. So when you fall asleep watching TV, several episodes play automatically, marking them as, "_Watched_". This Flo will help ensure only the current episode is marked, "_Watched_".

Unfortunately, the `Cancel` button isn't actually a UI Element and can only be found using a textual XPath search. Right now, English is supported.

I'll be happy to add support for other languages, if I'm provided with translations.
